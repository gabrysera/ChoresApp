    <string name="laundry1text">Check the care labels on your garments and linens.
        They will tell you whether or not an item can be machine washed. Also, every
        type of fabric has properties that determine how it reacts to heat, water,
        and cleaning solvents. Place all clothes that are labeled “wash separately”
        or “hand wash” into separate piles. If the label says, “dry clean only,” place
        it in a bag to take to the dry cleaner.</string>
    <string name="laundry2text">Start by sorting the laundry by color. Whites, pastels,
        light grays, and white background prints will go in one pile. Deep colored
        clothes—black, red, navy, brown, dark gray—go in another pile. Heavily soiled
        clothes should be washed separately.</string>
    <string name="laundry3text">Sort each pile one more time by type of fabric. For instance,
        in the whites pile, separate towels, and sheets from apparel. In the dark colors,
        separate t-shirts and jeans from lighter weight items like blouses and dress shirts.
        Washing by fabric type allows you to use different water temperatures and keeps drying
        cycles simple. To reduce lint, never wash lint producing fabrics and lint attracting
        fabrics together! If there are not enough items for a full washer load of each type of
        fabric and you are in a hurry, you can wash all items of each color together. Just be
        sure to choose the washer cycle to fit the most delicate garments in the load.</string>
    <string name="laundry4text">Select an all-purpose laundry detergent. Read the directions
        to determine how much to use based on the size of the load. If your clothes have stains,
        pre-treat them before washing so it doesn\'t set in. Simply apply a stain remover or
        rub in a bit of laundry detergent. Add the detergent to the washer drum or dispenser
        before loading it. This will prevent residue on your clothing.</string>
    <string name="laundry5text">Unless your clothing is caked with dirt and heavily stained,
        washing in cold water will serve your needs and prevent most laundry disasters. The
        exception is cotton underwear and bedsheets that need hot water to remove body oil.
        Bed linens and towels need to be washed at the highest recommended temperature at
        least every other wash to sanitize them. No matter the temperature, always rinse in
        cold water. The "normal" cycle will be fine for most loads, but you may also need to use
        "permanent press" or "delicate" for certain fabrics. "Heavy-duty" is great for articles
        like jeans and towels.</string>
    <string name="laundry6text">Take a bit of time to double-check everything before you load
        the washer. This will save you from any last-minute mistakes. Look for any stains and
        pretreat them. Certain types of stains require special techniques to remove them, while
        many can be handled with a spot treatment. There\'s also a proper approach for mystery
        stains when you\'re not sure what caused it. Also, check that all pockets are empty—no
        tissues or paper, either—to prevent disasters. Remove any accessories such as belts and
        jewelry. Close all zippers, VELCRO, and buttons to prevent them from catching the
        fabrics.</string>
    <string name="laundry7text">Load items into the washer one at a time, making sure they are
        not in a wad. Do not cram the washer too full. The clothes need room to move about in
        the water. To protect fabric finishes and reduce the “washed out” look, turn knitted
        items, corduroy, textured fabric, and dark colors inside out.</string>
    <string name="laundry8text">Promptly remove wet laundry from the washer to lessen wrinkles
        and prevent mildew. Hang items to air dry, lay flat to dry, or place them in the dryer.</string>
    <string name="laundry9text">If you did not separate loads by fabric type when washing, do
        it now before placing items in the dryer. It\'s important to dry all lightweight items
        together and all heavy fabric items together and choose the correct dryer temperature
        for each. This will help prevent shrinking and protect your clothing. There are many
        good reasons why you might consider hang drying your laundry. Chief among those are
        saving energy (and money) and less damage to your clothes. Not everyone can do this,
        though, because of space and weather restrictions.</string>
    <string name="laundry10text">As soon as your clothes are dry, you\'ll want to take care
        of them right away. Hang or fold each piece as it comes out of the dryer to prevent
        wrinkling. And, of course, iron if you must. As soon as possible, return clothes and
        linens to the proper closet or drawer.</string>
    <string name="laundrytips">Laundry is much less overwhelming if you do it frequently.
        If you let a mountain of dirty laundry accumulate, it can become scary. Even if it
        is a hassle to go to the laundry room or laundromat, try to use the time to read or
        relax and enjoy the scent of your fresh laundry.</string>
